    <p>Rishabh Rajendra Pant (born 4 October 1997) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian cricket team as a wicket-keeper batter. Having played all formats for India, he is best known for his consistency to score runs in Test cricket. Pant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and captains Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League.[3] He was the vice-captain of the India U-19 team that was runner up at the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.[4]</p>
    <p>At 19, Rishabh Pant has gone through all the highs and lows of a cricketing career. A promising talent from Delhi, Pant came into reckoning after his exploits for India Under-19 in the 2016 World Cup. A dashing left-handed wicket-keeper batsman, he lit up the tournament with a blitzing 24-ball 75, the fastest half-century of the tournament, against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia. India lost the title round - but came back with several positives - nothing bigger than the emergence of Pant
        Pant's heroics didn't go unnoticed, and days after his Nepal stunner, he was drafted in by the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL auctions. He gained a permanent place in Delhi's domestic circuit and by the end of the season was even named as their captain, albeit for the one-day format of the game. In between, he made his full India debut, against England in a Twenty20 international in Bengaluru.
        The second Ranji season for Rishabh wasn't as good as the first one. But he made up for that in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He smashed the second fastest hundred in the T-20 history in just 32 balls against Himachal Pradesh. This knock brought him into the selectors reckoning again and he was named in the Nidhas Trophy team.
        Pant again had a disappointing outing in his comeback match. He hasn't been himself at the international level and often tried to hit the ball too hard to his liking and failed to portray his hitting prowess. Strangely, his strike rate in the International T20 is just over 100 which is well below average for a power hitter.
        Pant is not a finished product by any stretch of the imagination but he has all the raw materials in him to excel at the International level. And this is the reason he has been retained by Delhi Daredevils where he will be playing under Gautam Gambhir and Ricky Ponting.</p>

    <p>The expertise that the IPL demands and the skill set that Rishabh Pant posses are absolutely in synchronization. If ever the definition of an ideal T20 batsman would be written, Rishabh Pant would tick most of the aspects. He is a ferocious hitter of the cricket ball wide a wide array of shots and can clear the boundary ropes with ridiculous ease. The scoops, the paddles, the flicks, you name it and this bloke has every shot in his repertoire.
        His career so far is an epitome of the Indian Premier League's timeline 'where talent meets opportunity.' Rishabh was picked up by Delhi Daredevils at a whopping price of 1.9 Crores in the 2016 auction. His first season didn't pan out the way Rishabh would have liked but he definitely vindicated the owners trust in 2017. A breakthrough season and Rishabh Pant had well and truly arrived. Going into the second season of the IPL, his confidence was sky-high and there were talks of an imminent India cap for the 2017 Champions Trophy. But life had another twist for the young batsman. Days before his team's first match - against Royal Challengers Bangalore, his father passed away, leaving a void difficult to fill. He came back to cricket from the tragedy, nearly guided his team home with a single-handed effort, and later blasted a blinding 97 against Gujarat Lions to finish the tournament with 366 runs.
        Rishabh was retained for the third season and he proved to be Delhi's only shining light in otherwise a pretty dark campaign. Throughout the season, Pant was responsible for demolishing the morale of the bowlers. His innings of 125 against SRH was one for the ages. The manner in which he took world-class Bhuvneshwar apart was a testimony to his grand stature as a T20 batsman. He will churn out for Delhi Capitals this year with an immense amount of international experience under his belt. And he would very well know a stellar season can fetch him a ticket to England for the World Cup.<br>

        A dasher, an aggressor or may be the perfect gen-next batsman, Rishabh Pant came in to the WC squad as a replacement for an injured Shikhar Dhawan. He was ignored for the initial squad which was picked for the WC but got his chance at the expense of Dhawan's injury. Being a left-hander, he might throw in a spanner in the opposition's plans if India use him judiciously in the middle overs. A see-the-ball and hit-the-ball approach might not come off very often but it will serve a lot of entertainment when it does come off. A good season for Delhi Daredevils just ahead of the World Cup would have also helped his mindset. His cricketing stocks have only risen high with many cricketing pundits batting for his inclusion in the side. Now that Pant has a go, he would want to make it count. The experience of playing Test cricket in England last year will also help him in adapting to the conditions better.

        Pant was purchased by the Delhi Daredevils ahead of the 2016 Indian Premier League on the same day he scored a century for India U-19 team in the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, guiding them into the semi-finals.[21] Playing his third game of the season, Pant made 69 runs off 40 balls to help Delhi secure an eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Lions.[22] In the 2017 season, he scored 97 runs from 43 balls against the same team.[23][24]
        During the 2018 Indian Premier League, Pant scored an unbeaten 128 from 63 balls against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, making it the then highest individual score by an Indian cricketer in IPL history.[25][26] He also became the second youngest player to score a century in the IPL.[27] In March 2021, Pant was named the captain of the Delhi Capitals for the 2021 Indian Premier League after the regular captain Shreyas Iyer was ruled out of the entire tournament due to an injury.[28][29] He was retained as captain for the 2022 IPL season as well.[30]<br>

        <h2 style="color: darkorange; background-color: azure;"><hr><center>Return to form (2020–present)</center><hr></h2>
        <p>India was bowled out for 36 in the second innings of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2020–21 and hence lost the test by 8 wickets despite getting a healthy first-innings lead.[62] Following this, Rishabh Pant was picked ahead of Wriddhiman Saha for the second test in Melbourne.[63]
            While Pant scored 29 in the first innings of the Melbourne Test,[64] it was at Sydney that he played a career-changing knock.[65] With 97 overs to survive on the last day, he played a counter-attacking knock of 97 runs off just 118 balls, also putting up a 148-run partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara.[66][67] The match ultimately ended in a draw.[68]
            India had many first-choice players unavailable due to injury,[69][70][71] and were the underdogs going into the match played in The Gabba where Australia had not been defeated since 1988.[72] Pant put in a match-winning performance on day five, as India chased down a target of 328 in the fourth innings,[73] scoring an unbeaten 89.[73]
            In September 2021, Pant was named in India's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.[74] At the annual ICC Awards in January 2022, Pant was named in ICC Men's Test Team of the Year for 2021.[75] In March 2022, during the second match against Sri Lanka, Pant scored the fastest half-century by a batter for India in a Test match, breaking the record previously held by Kapil Dev. He brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries.[76]
            In May 2022, Pant was named as the vice-captain of the Indian team for the South Africa tour of India 2022 series. However, one day before the first match of the series, Pant was named as the captain, after India's captain KL Rahul was ruled of the series out due to an injury.[7] At the age of 24 years and 248 days, Pant became the second-youngest captain to lead India in a T20I match.[77]
            In July 2022, in the final match of India's tour of England, Pant recorded his maiden century in ODI cricket scoring 125 runs and remaining not out.[78</p>
